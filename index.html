            <h2>About Elizabeth</h2>
            <p>I am Elizabeth Anuoluwapo Gabriel, having lived for 20+ years you can tell that I am gen-Z. My parents had me in the late 90's and being the first child of the family I wear a number of hats. Adulthood has taught me a lot about taking responsibility. Practically showing up to take the bull by the horn like no one is watching but clearly present are internal and external clouds of witnesses. I had my first degree in Economics from the University of Ilorin. 
                After the completion of the National Youth Service Scheme I moved on to bag a second degree in psychology from prestigious Lagos State University. From incessant passion to impact lives through teaching I went further to enrol for a post graduate diploma in education so as to enhance my teaching skills. Away from the walls of an academic space, I love to make products for sales. In the world of handy skills I am a baker. 
                
                In the last three years I have managed a 9 to 5 with my business. Part of my 2024 resolution was to acquire a tech based skill seeing that I was getting married and to run my home as I have envisaged I need a me paced kind of job which definitely is pegged on doing business or nailing at remote job opportunities. In the last quarter I made a decision to sharpen my skills technologically so as to be able to walk the path of remote jobs excellently even as I run my home. Fortunately, I was selected to be a part of the Glovo tech bootcamp in collaboration with She Code Academy where I am currently learning frontend Web development.
